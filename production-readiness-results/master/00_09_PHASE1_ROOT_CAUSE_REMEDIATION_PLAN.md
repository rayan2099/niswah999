# 00_09 — Phase 1: Root-Cause Remediation Plan

> **PLANNING ONLY. NOTHING IN THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.** No code, configuration, migration, or production-database change has been made as part of this phase. This plan requires explicit review and approval before any execution wave begins. Per the remediation charter, this supersedes no specialist remediation plan (`SEC_remediation_plan.md`, `DI_remediation_plan.md`, etc.) — it sequences and gates them against each other and against the Phase 0 evidence in `00_05_UNKNOWN_ASSUMPTION_REGISTER.md`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Baseline | `1.0.0+1` / commit `13a9387e9f2e5bbb0f61f7b13906d75e2f4d0d9f` |
| Precondition | Phase 0 complete — all 5 critical unknowns resolved (`00_05` §Phase 0 Resolution) |
| Status | **Wave 0 EXECUTED and COMPLETE (analysis/capture/isolated-validation only) — see `00_10_WAVE0_EXECUTION_REPORT.md` for full outputs A–K. No production mutation occurred; the proposed migration-repair operation (Output K) awaits separate explicit approval. Waves 1+ remain PROPOSED, not authorized.** |

> **Amendment (2026-09-04):** The release owner approved this plan with 17 binding amendments to Wave 0, incorporated into §4 below. In summary: the clean-rebuild gate is redefined as "zero material difference in application-owned schema," the canonical baseline must be deterministic (no blanket `IF NOT EXISTS`/`CREATE OR REPLACE` used to paper over drift), every live object must be classified into one of five categories before being canonized, no live migration-ledger or schema change of any kind occurs during Wave 0, and the migration-repair step at the end requires a separate, explicit, out-of-band approval — this document only *proposes* the exact command at that point, it does not execute it.

---

## 1. The One Rule That Governs Every Wave Below

> **No live production database mutation of any kind — schema, RLS policy, trigger, index, constraint, or migration-ledger metadata — may occur until Wave 0 (§4) is complete.**

This is stricter than "be careful." It applies even to changes that look small or safe in isolation (e.g. `SEC-004`'s RLS policy fix, `DI-011`'s `UNIQUE` constraint) — because Phase 0 proved the current migration chain does not replay, so *any* new migration authored on top of it inherits an unverified foundation. Every wave below is tagged **DB mutation: YES/NO**, and every YES is gated on Wave 0.

App-code-only changes (Flutter client, Edge Function logic, CI, signing config) are **not** subject to this gate and may proceed in parallel with Wave 0.

---

## 2. Findings Already Closed by Phase 0 — Excluded From Remediation

| Finding | Disposition | Why no remediation is needed |
|---|---|---|
| `AB-001` | **VERIFIED CLOSED** | Gemini endpoint/shape confirmed real and functional by live smoke test. No fix required. |
| `CQ-010` | **VERIFIED CLOSED** | Same evidence as `AB-001`. |
| `ROOT-001` | **DISPROVEN** | Not a defect. Removed from all remediation sequencing below. |
| `DI-004` | **CLOSED (favorable)** | Live-only trigger (`auth_users_create_profile`→`create_user_profile()`) populates `public.users` today. No FK-violation remediation needed on the *current* live table. |
| `PJ-001` | **CLOSED (favorable)** | Same mechanism as `DI-004`. The write path works today. |

**Important:** closing these findings does **not** remove their underlying evidence from this plan — the *mechanism* that makes `DI-004`/`PJ-001` safe (an untracked, live-only trigger) is now the leading evidence for Wave 0's priority. See §3.

`PC-002` is **not** closed, but its scope is narrowed (§7, Wave 5) — a working `delete_my_account()` RPC already exists; the fix is wiring, not building.

---

## 3. Findings Confirmed / Deepened by Phase 0 — Elevated Priority

| Finding | Change |
|---|---|
| `BR-001` | Was "critical unknown." Now **CONFIRMED**: `pitr_enabled: false`, zero backups exist. |
| `BR-002` | Was "traced by audit." Now **CONFIRMED twice, independently** (manual replay + official CLI shadow-db). |
| `DI-001` | **CONFIRMED, deepened**: live schema is a third variant matching neither `schema.sql` nor migrations; `chat_history` table and `create_user_profile()`/`delete_my_account()` functions exist **only** in production. |
| `ROOT-007` | Escalated from "highest" (tied with `ROOT-002`/`ROOT-005`) to **the single gating prerequisite for this entire plan** — see §4. |

---

## 4. Wave 0 — Production Database Preservation & Reproducibility (Priority 0, PREREQUISITE)

**Findings addressed:** `BR-001`, `BR-002`, `BR-003`, `BR-004`, `BR-005`, `BR-007`, `BR-008`, `DI-001`, `DI-005`, `DI-006`, `DI-004`/`PJ-001` (informing, already closed — see §4.0.4).
**Affected audits:** Database, Backup & Recovery, Final User Journey.
**Dependencies:** None — this is the root prerequisite.
**Production access required:** Read-only throughout this wave. **Zero live schema, RLS, function, trigger, or migration-ledger writes occur in Wave 0.** The one operation with any live-mutation potential (§4.11, migration repair) is *proposed only* at the end — it is not executed without a separate, explicit, out-of-band approval.
**Regression risk to production:** None — nothing in this wave touches production write paths.

### 4.0 — Definitions (binding for this wave and all later gated waves)

**4.0.1 — Clean-rebuild exit criterion (amended).** The gate is: **zero material difference across application-owned schema and required application behavior.** It is *not* literal zero-diff against every object Supabase's platform itself manages. Application-owned scope includes, where applicable: public tables, columns, constraints, indexes, RLS policies, application functions, RPCs, application-relevant triggers, and the auth-to-public integration logic Niswah actually depends on (the two provisioning triggers, `delete_my_account()`). Supabase-managed internals (platform schemas such as `auth`'s own internal tables/functions not authored by this project, `storage`'s internal machinery, `realtime`, `_analytics`, `pgbouncer`, `supabase_admin`-owned objects, etc.) are documented separately as platform context, not blindly reproduced or asserted equal.

**4.0.2 — Deterministic baseline (amended).** The canonical baseline migration must **not** use `IF NOT EXISTS` or `CREATE OR REPLACE` merely to paper over uncertainty about existing state. Default statements are plain `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, etc. — which already fail loudly (Postgres raises a duplicate-object error) if reality doesn't match expectation, which is the desired behavior per this amendment. Idempotent guards are permitted **only** where a specific, named technical reason requires them (e.g. `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"` — extensions are commonly pre-installed by the platform itself and a bare `CREATE EXTENSION` failing on "already exists" is not a meaningful signal), and every such exception must be commented in the baseline file explaining why.

**4.0.3 — Object classification (new requirement).** Every live object inventoried in §4.2 must be classified as exactly one of:
- `REQUIRED_APPLICATION_OBJECT` — the app depends on it; must appear in the canonical baseline.
- `SUPABASE_MANAGED` — platform-owned; documented, not reproduced.
- `LEGACY_BUT_CURRENTLY_REFERENCED` — old naming/shape (e.g. `prayer_log`, `pregnancy_records`, `secret_vault`) that live code still actually reads/writes; preserved under its live name in the baseline, flagged for a later, deliberate rename decision (not bundled into Wave 0).
- `UNREFERENCED / CANDIDATE_FOR_LATER_REMOVAL` — exists live, nothing in `lib/`/`supabase/functions/` references it; preserved in the baseline (removal is destructive and out of scope for a capture wave) but flagged for a future, separately-authorized cleanup migration.
- `UNKNOWN — REVIEW REQUIRED` — cannot be classified confidently from available evidence; preserved as-is, flagged for release-owner review before any future change touches it.
No object is silently canonized as permanent architecture just because it exists in production.

**4.0.4 — Phase 0 findings preserved.** `AB-001`, `CQ-010`, `ROOT-001`, `DI-004`, `PJ-001` keep their Phase 0 dispositions (§2) unless Wave 0 surfaces evidence that contradicts them. Wave 0 does add new root-cause implications from the hidden-trigger discovery (see `UNK-006`'s "however" paragraph in `00_05`) — those implications feed `DI-001`/`ROOT-007`, not a reopening of `DI-004`/`PJ-001` themselves.

### 4.1 — Establish a safe recovery point *(OWNER ACTION REQUIRED where platform-level; independent logical export performed by this session)*

Per the amended recovery prerequisite: the preferred state is Supabase PITR/backup enabled **plus** an independent logical export. Phase 0 confirmed `pitr_enabled: false`, `backups: []` — enabling PITR is very likely a plan-tier/billing decision outside what this session can or should perform unilaterally; it is called out explicitly, not silently assumed. **This session will produce the independent logical export itself** (schema-only, safe; data-only handled per §4.6's privacy constraint) as the recovery artifact this wave actually tests against (§4.10). If PITR remains disabled, that is recorded as **continuing residual risk**, not treated as equivalent to a manual dump — a manual export is a one-point-in-time artifact, not continuous protection.
- DB mutation: No.
- Exit criterion (Wave 0 scope): at least one independent logical export exists and has been restore-tested (§4.10). Full exit criterion for *later* production-mutating waves additionally requires platform PITR/backup — see §4.12.

### 4.2 — Authoritative live capture (read-only)

Produce a complete, application-relevant inventory, per schema, covering: tables, columns, data types, defaults, primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints, indexes, RLS enabled/disabled state, RLS policies, functions, RPCs, triggers, extensions relied upon, `auth.users` integration logic, and any Storage-related application objects if Storage is actually in use. Stored under a new, clearly-labeled path — **not** overwriting `schema.sql` yet.
- DB mutation: No.

### 4.3 — Object classification report

Classify every object from §4.2 into the §4.0.3 taxonomy. Produced as a standalone, reviewable table (see Output B, §4.14).
- DB mutation: No.

### 4.4 — Three-way comparison

For every object: present/absent/matching across **A. live production**, **B. `supabase/schema.sql`**, **C. `supabase/migrations/`**. This is the definitive "what is actually true" ledger `DI-001`/`BR-002` have circled since Wave 1 of the original audit.
- DB mutation: No.

### 4.5 — Understand preserved known-good behavior (before touching anything)

For each of `auth_users_create_profile`→`create_user_profile()`, `on_auth_user_created`→`handle_new_user()`, and `delete_my_account()`: read the exact live definition, trace every table/column it touches, every RLS policy that gates it, and every downstream cascade or side effect. Do not rewrite or replace any of them in this wave — this step is understanding only. `delete_my_account()`'s exact cascade/anonymization scope is tested behaviorally in §4.10.F, not assumed from reading the SQL alone.
- DB mutation: No.

### 4.6 — Preserve production data (constrained)

An independent **data**-only export is a real point-in-time artifact containing real health/religious/message data. Per this session's own operating constraints (never handle real user PHI-adjacent data outside owner-managed storage), any data-only export is **not** pulled into this session's local/disposable environment — it is documented as a required artifact for the release owner to produce and store in encrypted, access-controlled storage, not committed to git and not staged locally by this session. The restore test in §4.10 instead uses **synthetic** data created fresh inside the isolated test environment, which validates the *mechanism* without handling real records.
- DB mutation: No.

### 4.7 — Canonical baseline: proposed, not deployed

Draft **one** new, deterministic (§4.0.2) baseline migration file that reproduces every object classified `REQUIRED_APPLICATION_OBJECT` or `LEGACY_BUT_CURRENTLY_REFERENCED` (under its **live** name — e.g. `prayer_log`, not the never-applied `prayer_entries` rename), including both provisioning triggers/functions and `delete_my_account()`, verbatim as captured. `SUPABASE_MANAGED` objects are excluded and documented separately (§4.0.1). `UNREFERENCED`/`UNKNOWN` objects are included (to avoid silent data loss) but explicitly commented as flagged for future review, not asserted as intentional architecture. All 12 existing migration files are marked "SUPERSEDED — historical, do not replay" in place (`DI-006`'s append-only convention) — never deleted. `schema.sql` is regenerated from this baseline once it passes §4.9, becoming a generated artifact rather than hand-maintained.
- **Explicitly out of scope for this file:** any *behavioral* change (e.g. renaming `prayer_log`→`prayer_entries`, or `DI-004`'s original FK-retarget idea) — capture reality first; improve it later, deliberately, in a reviewed follow-up wave.
- DB mutation: No — this authors a new file in the repository only. **Not applied to production in this wave.**

### 4.8 — Clean rebuild test, isolated environment *(hard gate)*

Fresh, isolated Supabase-local-stack or disposable Postgres. From an empty starting point: (1) apply the §4.7 baseline; (2) verify every `REQUIRED_APPLICATION_OBJECT`/`LEGACY_BUT_CURRENTLY_REFERENCED` table/column/constraint/index/policy exists as expected; (3) verify every function/RPC/trigger exists and is callable; (4) verify basic connectivity (a client can connect and query); (5) confirm the entire rebuild required **zero** manual Studio/SQL-editor steps. **Exit criterion (amended): zero material difference in application-owned schema** against the §4.2 live capture — not literal identity with Supabase-managed internals.
- DB mutation: No (isolated test environment only).

### 4.9 — Behavioral rebuild validation *(the exit test verifies behavior, not only schema)*

Inside the same isolated environment, with synthetic data only:
- **A. Auth signup** — insert a synthetic `auth.users` row; verify both `public.profiles` and `public.users` rows are created correctly by the two live triggers.
- **B. Authorization/RLS** — as two distinct synthetic authenticated roles, verify representative permitted access (own row) and denied access (another user's row) on at least one RLS-protected table.
- **C. Cycle data** — representative `cycle_entries` (or its live name) write + read-back.
- **D. Pregnancy data** — representative `pregnancy_profile` write + read-back.
- **E. Profile data** — representative `profiles`/`users` persistence check.
- **F. Account deletion** — call `delete_my_account()` against synthetic populated data; document exactly what it deletes, cascades, anonymizes, and leaves behind, and whether the resulting state is technically consistent (cross-reference `DI-012`'s other-participant-message-visibility concern).
- **G. Application startup** — verified at the DB/API connectivity level (a client can connect and issue representative queries against the rebuilt schema). **Scope limitation, stated plainly:** this session does not have a way to boot the actual Flutter mobile app UI (emulator/device) against the rebuilt environment; that remains a manual verification step for whoever holds the mobile toolchain, not claimed as done here.
- **H. Representative E2E journeys** — validated at the DB-behavior level for the journeys database reconstruction affects (cycle logging, chat persistence, account deletion); full UI-level E2E is out of this session's reach for the same reason as G, and is explicitly not claimed.
- DB mutation: No (isolated test environment only).

### 4.10 — Restore test

Using the independent logical schema export (§4.1) plus synthetic data (§4.6's constraint): restore into a second, separate isolated environment and verify schema integrity, representative data integrity, and basic application-level (API/connectivity) compatibility. Record the exact procedure and evidence. This satisfies `BR-008`'s Golden Rule (an unexercised backup is unverified) **for the mechanism** — it does not substitute for the release owner separately restore-testing a real production backup once platform PITR/backups exist (§4.1's residual-risk note).
- DB mutation: No to live; yes to the disposable restore target only.

### 4.11 — Migration repair: proposed, not executed

Migration repair is **not** performed automatically, and not performed in this wave at all. Only after §4.2–§4.10 all pass does this document stop and present the **exact** proposed `supabase migration repair` command(s) — target version(s), intended before/after ledger state, exact effect, why it's required, rollback path, and the specific evidence (from §4.2–§4.10) that justifies it. Execution requires a separate, explicit approval. See §4.15 Output K.
- DB mutation: **None in Wave 0.** The eventual command, if and when approved, is metadata-only against Supabase's migration ledger — no schema DDL against `public`/`auth`.

### 4.12 — Wave 0 Exit Criteria

- [ ] 4.2–4.4: complete live-vs-repo comparison ledger produced and reviewed
- [ ] 4.3: every object classified per §4.0.3, no object silently canonized
- [ ] 4.5: known-good trigger/function/RPC behavior understood and documented before any preservation decision
- [ ] 4.7: deterministic baseline authored (no unjustified `IF NOT EXISTS`/`CREATE OR REPLACE`)
- [ ] 4.8: clean rebuild passes with zero material difference in application-owned schema
- [ ] 4.9: behavioral validation A–F pass in the isolated environment (G/H validated at DB-connectivity level only, scope limitation stated)
- [ ] 4.10: restore test demonstrated (mechanism-level, synthetic data)
- [ ] 4.11: proposed migration-repair operation presented and **awaiting separate explicit approval** — not executed
- [ ] §4.1's platform PITR/backup gap remains **open, documented residual risk** — required before *any later wave's* DB mutation, per §1's blanket rule, even though Wave 0 itself does not depend on it beyond the restore test

### 4.13 — Production Safety Rule

If any command in this wave's execution *could* mutate live production state, this session stops before running it and states: the exact command, the exact target, the exact effect, why it is required, the rollback/recovery path, and the evidence that all prerequisites passed — then waits for explicit approval. This applies with no exceptions in Wave 0, including to §4.11.

### 4.14 — Outputs Required at End of Wave 0

A. Authoritative live-object inventory · B. Object classification report · C. Live-vs-`schema.sql`-vs-migrations comparison · D. Proposed canonical baseline (file, not deployed) · E. Recovery/backup evidence (including the platform PITR/backup residual-risk statement) · F. Clean-rebuild report · G. Behavioral validation report (A–H, with G/H scope limitation stated) · H. Restore-test report · I. Remaining material discrepancies · J. Affected finding IDs and updated status (finding discipline per §4.0.4 — no automatic closure) · K. Exact proposed first live operation (migration repair), if still required, awaiting approval.

| **P3 — Observability / detection gap** | `OB-001–012` (shared with P1a), `RR-002` (shared) | Observability, Reliability | Coordinated with P1a (same PRs where practical); `OB-010`'s DB audit-log trigger needs **Wave 0 complete** | Crash/error SDK, structured logging, alerting, version tagging, kill-switch (`OB` plan R1–R3) | Low — mostly additive | Feature-flaggable SDK/config | Synthetic failure injection per alert defined in `OB` plan §4 | All journeys (this is the mechanism that proves the P1a fixes worked) |

| Wave | Priority | Finding IDs | Files/components | Prod access? | DB mutation? | Backup prerequisite | Regression tests | Specialist audits to rerun | E2E journeys to rerun | Rollback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | P0 (gate) | `BR-001–008`, `DI-001,005,006` | New `supabase/live_schema_capture/`, one new baseline migration, `schema.sql` regenerated | Yes (read-only + 1 metadata write) | Yes (ledger metadata only, step 4.11) | **N/A — this wave establishes it** | Zero-diff rebuild test; restore test | Database, Backup & Recovery | None | `migration repair --status reverted` |

| **2** | P2 | `SEC-001,002,005,006,DC-001,003,CQ-004,005,AB-002-013` | New edge functions, `gemini_service.dart` removal, `app_environment.dart` | Yes (Edge Function deploy + secret rotation) | No (Edge Function/secret config, not schema) | Not required for deployment; rotation gated on old-build retirement, not on Wave 0 | Asset-bundle secret scan; full AI E2E | Security, API/Backend, Code Quality | AI Advisor, Dream Interpreter, Dr. Niswah chat, general assistant | Feature-flagged fallback during rollout |
| **3** | P3 | `OB-001–012` | `main.dart`, new logging abstraction, `failures.dart`, (one DB audit-log trigger) | Mostly no; the one audit-log trigger (`OB-010`) needs prod access | Mostly No; `OB-010`'s trigger is **Yes** | `OB-010` sub-item only: **requires Wave 0 complete** | Synthetic failure injection per alert | Observability | All (this proves P1a worked) | SDK/config disable |

Migration-deployment-process definition: conceptual only | No, **except** the migration-deployment-process definition depends on Wave 0's *output* (not itself a mutation) | Signing/CI: not required. Deployment-process definition: **requires Wave 0 complete** | Signature verification; CI failure-injection | Release/Deployment, Dependencies/Config | None functionally | Debug-signed non-prod path retained |
| **5** | P5 | `PC-001-011` | New "Delete account" screen, sign-up handler wiring, onboarding copy | Yes (RPC verification against live capture) | Only if `consent_events` table is adopted (**Yes**, gated) | RPC-verification sub-step needs Wave 0's read-only capture only (4.2/4.3); `consent_events` table needs full Wave 0 | Synthetic account create→delete→verify-zero-rows | Privacy/Compliance | Onboarding/consent, account deletion | Feature-flagged deletion rollout |
| **6** | P6 | `CQ-001,003,005,006,008,011,DC-008,009,011,012` | Dead-code removal, orphaned root files | No | No | Not required | `flutter analyze`; existing suite | Code Quality | None | Git revert |

## 7. Parallelization Guidance

Waves **0, 1a, 2, 3 (minus `OB-010`), 4 (minus deployment-process definition), 6, 7**, and Wave 5's RPC-verification sub-step can all start **simultaneously** — none of them depend on each other or require live schema mutation. This is the fastest path to closing the largest number of BLOCKER findings without serializing unnecessarily.

Waves **1b, 1c**, `OB-010`, the migration-deployment-process definition (Wave 4), and `PC-002`'s `consent_events` table (Wave 5, if adopted) are the only items gated on Wave 0's full completion (§4.12).

The privacy-policy authorship (legal track, feeds `PC-001,003,004,006,007,009` and `RD-007`) is slow and external — start it immediately, in parallel, since multiple other items block on its output.

## 8. What This Plan Does Not Do

Per the charter: this plan does not implement any fix, does not touch the live database, and does not close any finding. Closure requires implementation, the specialist test named in §5/§6, and (for BLOCKER/HIGH findings) a rerun of the owning specialist audit plus the applicable Final Pre-Launch User Journey and Release & Deployment validations, per the charter's post-remediation regeneration requirement.

**Awaiting your review and approval of this sequencing before any wave begins.**
